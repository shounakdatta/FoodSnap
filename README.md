Had an event? Have tons of leftovers? Don't know who to call, what to say, what to do? Easy!

FoodSnap is an integrated mobile app that uses image recognition and mobile location data to detect what food you have left over and where it can be picked up. What's even cooler is that all of the data is automatically compiled into a social media post for you, making food sharing so much simpler. All you have to do is take a picture and hit submit. Your post will be all over local food distribution channels :smile:
